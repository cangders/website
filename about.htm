	<h2><em class="page">About Me</em></h2>
	
	<ul class="intro">
		<li>
		<p>I graduated from <em>DePaul University</em> with a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science and minors in Professional Writing and Industrial 
		&amp; Organizational Psychology. While at DePaul, I earned a Leadership Certificate from the Student Leadership Institute. I also served 
		as a student mentor for first-year students and coached new student mentors.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>While being a full-time undergraduate student, I also worked for the <em>U.S. Department of State</em> as a Program Assistant supporting the regulation of foreign missions activities in the United States. My responsibilities 
		included project management, information design, and database development. I developed and maintained databases, managed the drafting of 
		various publications, and coordinated meetings and conferences.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>The coursework I completed for my Professional Writing minor coupled with my project experiences at the State Department motivated 
		me to complete a Master's of Science degree in Technical Communication and Information Design at <em>Illinois Institute of Technology</em> (IIT). While at IIT, I accepted
		 an assistantship with the Collaboration and Social Media Lab (CaSM) collecting and analyzing data from data mining and interviews in support of quantitative and qualitative research.
		Through that experience, I realized that I enjoyed organizing and managing information, whether that information is in the form of words in a newsletter or data in a content 
		management system. </p></li> <li><p>To further my career development in information management, I work at <em>Deloitte Touche 
		Tohmatsu</em> Limited's Global Technology Services. I am an active leader in the organization’s community of practice, passionate about learning and development, facilitating study programs to help colleagues become IIBA® certified. I have led global cross-functional teams through agile methodology, conducted feasibility studies and vendor evaluations, and managed operations of in-house developed and vendor products to ensure solutions excellence. I have also led initiatives to increase organizational Cultural Awareness through gamification and led societal impact projects to motivate and inspire high school students to learn how to code.</p>
